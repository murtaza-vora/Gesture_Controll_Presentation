# Gesture_Controll_Presentation
Gesture Controll Presentation
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸš€

I've developed an innovative OpenCV application that allows you to control your presentation using hand gestures! ðŸ™Œ

Key Features:

Slide Navigation: Easily navigate through your presentation slides with simple hand gestures, moving forward and backward seamlessly.
Drawing & Annotations: Make your presentations more interactive by drawing or writing on your slides in real-time.
Erase Annotations: Quickly erase any annotations with a gesture, keeping your slides clean and organized.
This project leverages computer vision and hand tracking technology to enhance the way we deliver presentations, making them more dynamic and engaging.

ðŸ’» Technologies used:

OpenCV
HandDetector from cvzone
Python
I'm thrilled with how it turned out and eager to hear your thoughts and feedback!
